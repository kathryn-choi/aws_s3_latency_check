AWS  S3 Latency Check
=============================

Check S3 Latency for each region when putting, getting and deleting files. It'll test 10 times for each file and calculate the average latency for each region and file. <br>

## How To Set Up
 Follow `Configuration` part of [Boto3 Document](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html).<br>
 Run `python3 main.py`
 
## File Size & Region List 
```
file_list = ['1K', '10K', '1M', '10M']
region_list :  {'US East(Ohio)':'us-east-2','US East(N.Virginia)':'us-east-1', 'US West(N.California)':'us-west-1', 'US West(Oregon)':'us-west-2',
              'Asia Pacific (Mumbai)':'ap-south-1', 'Asia Pacific (Seoul)':'ap-northeast-2','Asia Pacific (Tokyo)':'ap-northeast-1','Asia Pacific (Singapore)':'ap-southeast-1',
              'Asia Pacific (Sydney)':'ap-southeast-2','Canada (Central)':'ca-central-1','EU (Frankfurt)':'eu-central-1','EU (Ireland)':'eu-west-1',
              'EU (London)':'eu-west-2', 'EU (Paris)':'eu-west-3', 'EU (Stockholm)':'eu-north-1', 'South America (SÃ£o Paulo)':'sa-east-1'}
```

## Sample of output_file
After calculating the latency, it'll create the output file `output_file.txt` . <br>
Here's some sample of `output_file.txt` <br>
